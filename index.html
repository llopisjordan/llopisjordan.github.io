    <p>Something that I find interesting is the Monterey Bay Aquarium. At the aquarium, they have so many different species of fish, sharks, squid, and other sea life. I love the sea otter enclosure because they are really cool animals and they love to play around with toys or each other, making it fun to watch them. The coolest exibit is called the Open Sea that is <strong> one million gallons in size </strong> with huge schools of fish, sharks, sea turtles and more.
